This Code Only Works to Transfer Text Delimited Files From Windows Machine to Linux Machine, However little customization could be great to make this code to work for any platform.

<b>Prerequisite</b>
  
1. MySQL (Any Version)
2. Python (Ver: 3.5 + would be great)
3. Windows Machine
4. Putty

There is some fields where you need to replace with your required details.

`mysql_user => Replace with your user name.`<br>
mysql_password => Replace with your user's password.<br>
mysql_host => Replace with MySQL host.<br>
mysql_database => Replace with your database name.<br>
mysql_table => Replace with your table name.<br>
Target Directory Path of Linux Server => Replace with your linux server direcorty path where you want to place the meta files.<br>
DNS => Replace with your DNS name.<br>
Store Proc For OutFile => Replace with your store procedure for outfile.<br>

Once you edited the code you are now good to go.

Open the window cmd and navigate to directory where you placed the code.

py file_name.py

Thanks.
