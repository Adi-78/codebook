This Code Only Works to Transfer Text Delimited Files From Windows Machine to Linux Machine, However title customization could be great to make this code to work for any platform.

<prerequisite>
  
  1. MySQL (Any Version)
  2. Python (Ver: 3.5 + would be great)
  3. Windows Machine
  4. putty

There is some fields where you need to replace with your required details.

<mysql_user> = Replace with your user name.
<mysql_password> = Replace with your user's password.
<mysql_host> = Replace with MySQL host.
<mysql_database> = Replace with your database name.
<mysql_table> = Replace with your table name.
<Target Directory Path of Linux Server> = Replace with your linux server direcorty path where you want to place the meta files.
<DNS> = Replace with your DNS name.
<Store Proc For OutFile> = Replace with your store procedure for outfile.
 
Once your edited the code you are now good to go.

Open the window cmd and navigate to directory where you placed the code.

py meta_data_loader.py

Thanks.
